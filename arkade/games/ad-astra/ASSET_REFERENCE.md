The system works great with NO image! Just test it first with the gradient 
background, then add your beautiful artwork when ready. No pressure! 🎨

**Test Before Creating:**
1. Copy the 3 JS files
2. Test the trading system
3. See if you like the layout
4. Then create your perfect background image

## 📝 NOTES:

- Image will have 95% dark overlay for text readability
- Don't worry about text placement - that's handled by CSS
- Focus on creating an atmospheric background
- Subtle details work better than busy scenes
- The gradient overlay will darken it significantly
